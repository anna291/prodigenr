Are you an academic researcher who often writes up abstracts for conferences or
submits manuscripts to journals? Do you often have to make slides or posters for
presentations? Is your usual workflow to copy a previous project and start 
replacing the old text for the new text? This R package was designed with you in
mind!

prodigenr, or *pro*ject *di*rectory *gen*erator, simplifies the process of
creating these new projects and can help make your workflow more reproducible.
Standard files and folders are created for specific projects (e.g. abstracts or
manuscripts), along with a workflow that tries to be simple and easy to use,
while making use of the infrastructure and processes already well-developed and
maintained (e.g. RStudio and devtools).

Because researchers often write or create many papers, slides, posters, and
abstracts, it can quickly become tedious and messy to always make a new
directory with all the necessary files and organization. 

## Setting up a project with prodigenr

Starting a research project? Create a project directory like so:

```{r manuscript-proj}
library(prodigenr)
# Create a temporary folder using the fs package
new_project_path <- fs::path_temp("HeartDiseaseExercise")
setup_project(new_project_path)
```

Or via RStudio's interface (with RStudio version >1.1):

![Creating a prodigenr project in RStudio](../man/figures/rstudio-projects.gif)

The resulting file structure should look something like this:

```{r folder_tree, echo=FALSE, comment="", results="markup"}
fs::dir_tree(new_project_path)
```

Ok, now you can open up the newly created R project file (`.Rproj`). A
`README.md` file is contained within each project and each folder that explains
more about what each folder does and what some of the files do that were
created. To add the main document type (e.g. slides, manuscript), run any of the
`create_*()` commands (e.g. `create_manuscript()`) in the console of the project.

```{r example-create-function, eval=FALSE}
# you need to run these in the project's console
create_manuscript()
create_slides()
```

```{r poster_abstract_hide, echo=FALSE}
# you need to run these in the project's console
withr::with_dir(
    new = new_project_path,
    code = {
        create_manuscript()
        create_slides()
    }
)
```

Which will now add two more files to the `doc/` folder. The resulting file
structure should look something like this:

```{r file_structure_with_doc, echo=FALSE, results="markup", comment=""}
fs::dir_tree(new_project_path)
```

At present, there are only two template files that you can view using:

```{r templates}
template_list
```

These template files are what an academic researcher likely typically encounters.
However, if you have a suggestion or want to add a template, please create a
[Github issue](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr/issues) or submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/rostools/prodigenr/pulls)!

The end goal of each project is to be as self contained as possible. So that if
you ever need to go back to the analysis, it is easy to re-run the code and get
the results that you say you got. This is especially useful if others such as
reviewers ask for something or want to confirm your results. For more
information on good practices to use in making an analysis project, see 
[here](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2910/how-to-efficiently-manage-a-statistical-analysis-project)
or

the underlying philosophy behind this package (and soon to be others). 

<!-- TODO: Add typical workflow in the rostools manifesto and link to there -->

## Workflow when using projects created from `prodigenr`

A typical workflow, which is also outlined in the README.md of the created
project, would be to:

1. Write up your analysis and associated written explanations of the results, as
you would for any research project, in the abstract, poster, slides, or
manuscript `.Rmd` ([R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)) file in the
`doc/` folder.
2. Any piece of code you use more than once or is fairly complex, convert it
into a function. Put this new function into a file (or a `functions.R` file) in the
`R/` directory. Load that function using `devtools::load_all()` (Ctrl-Shift-L).
3. Fetch and wrangle your data in the `R/fetch_data.R`. You can access the
data using the `devtools::load_all()` function.
4. Create more Rmd files in the `doc/` folder to add analyses that will
supplement the main document or that are exploratory.
5. Knit the `.Rmd` file in `doc/`. You now have your final abstract, poster,
slides, or manuscript to use for your research.

## Related packages or projects

There are several ways of handling a project. There is at least two packages
that have similar goals as `prodigenr` as well as through the use of the R
package structure:

- [`ProjectTemplate`](http://projecttemplate.net/) is well documented and still
actively developed. Only downside is that it is fairly complicated to use and
complex in the project workflow it creates.
- [`makeProject`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeProject)
is very simple and stripped down in what it creates and in it's use. Downside is
that it wasn't updated since 2012.
- Use of the R package structure via
[`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) (or
[`usethis`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis)),
which is argued for in this
[blog](https://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/vignetteAnalysis.html) and
compared to `ProjectTemplate` in this
[blog](https://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/zpackages_vs_projectTemplate.html)).
- [`rrtools`](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) is very similar to prodigenr, 
except it focuses only on manuscripts. Is well thought out and the documentation
is well written.
- [`workflowr`](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) is a workflow for creating
online, data science content.

There is also a list of other similar projects 
[on the rOpenSci GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg#useful-tools-and-templates-for-making-research-compendia). 
It's up to you to decide which style to use. 





## Folders and files

This standard folder and file structure is a step toward being more
reproducible. The project directory is generally structured with the
following folders:

- `R/`: Contains R scripts.
- `doc/`: Contains files related to presenting the project's scientific output
(e.g. manuscript).
- `data/`: Contains the original or simulated data and the results of the project analyses.
- `.git`: The Git version control history and related files. Used *only* by Git,
do not manually edit.

The base folder contains a few files:

- `.gitignore` tells [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to ignore certain files from
being tracked and prevents them from entering the version control history.
- `DESCRIPTION` is a standard file that includes metadata about your project, in
a machine readable format for others to obtain information on about your
project. It provides a description of what the project does and most importantly
what R packages your project uses on.
- The `{{ProjectName}}.Rproj` file dictates that the directory is a RStudio
project. Open the project by opening this file.

All folders have their own README files inside with more specific details.

for details on this setup and workflow. As this layout is also based
on R packages, check out the online book on [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
to learn more about how to make the most use out of this project layout.

It's recommended that if a piece of code
is used more than once in your analysis files, make it into a function and put
it here so that you "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY principle). Or even if the
piece of code is complicated, put it into a function to then document what it
does. One recommended approach is to create a function or script for each main
output item (each figure, table, etc) in a scientific product (e.g.
`figure_one()` to create figure one).

Use 'Insert Roxygen Skeleton' (Ctrl-Alt-Shift-R) to document
individual functions.

Best practice is to split the functions/code up into individual files based on what
the functions or code do. For example, have one file for plotting functions (plots.R),
another for data wrangling functions (wrangle.R), and so on. The code in
the `R/` folder can be accessible by either: running `devtools::load_all()`
(Ctrl-Shift-L) for interactive use or within the Rmd files so that another
document format (e.g. Word) can be knitted; or, by running `source(here::here("R/filename.R"))`
if the code has been written as a script.
