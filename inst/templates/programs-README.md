# Description of R/ folder and .R files

This folder contains custom functions/macros or R/SAS scripts used for this project's
analyses, such as in the `Results/` folder. 

# Default R file
By default the R file "DocumentCreation_Git.R" is included in this folder. When running this program, you can create an SAP or statistical report template which will be saved in the suitable folder. Additionally, a connection to Git can be setup.

# For R Studio
Each R script is split up into sections (e.g. with RStudio's 'Insert Section' with Ctrl-Shift-R) by utility or purpose. You can use the 'Document Outline' (Ctrl-Shift-O) to see the sections and functions.
