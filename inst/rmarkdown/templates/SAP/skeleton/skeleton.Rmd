\newpage

A statistical analysis plan includes many features of a research project with a particular emphasis on mapping out how research questions will be answered and what is necessary to answer the question.

## Outline proposed analytical strategy
Include: 

- Outline of main comparison groups 

- Frequency and cross-tabulations of main variables 

- Basic analysis model (usually age- and sex-adjusted)

- Final analysis model (including adjustment for other confounders) 


## Analysis dissemination strategy
Outline the intended steps to be taken to disseminate the results of the study (i.e. will the results be published, presented at a conference etc.).

## Interpretation
Detail how you will interpret the results in the context of your stated hypothesis. I.e. if the results do/do not meet your hypothesis, what will you conclude? A concept map (see below) may assist with this.

## Concept map
Concept map or directed acyclic graph Drawing a diagram of the ways in which the exposure might be related to the outcome will help to visualise your hypotheses as well as serving as a basis for clearly communicating this to your collaborators. The diagram should include the possible confounders or mediators of the relationship. This will require good knowledge of the background to the study

## Dummy tables and Charts
Dummy tables and charts are empty skeleton tables and charts which show how the results will be presented but which do not contain any data/results.
